# tyronZIL DID-Create operation

A tyronZIL DID-Create operation is conformant with a Sidetree Create Operation, and its goal is to generate a brand new tyronZIL Decentralized Identifier.

Follow these steps:

## 1. Verification methods

tyronZIL-v0.4 supports 1 kind of verification method: 'publicKey'

1.1 Under the property 'publicKey', assing to its value an array of keys of type [PublicKeyModel](../../implementation/models.md#public-key-model), generated using the [operation key pair](../../sidetree.md#operation-key-pair):

```publicKeys: PublicKeyModel[]```

## 2. Public-key commitments

2.1 For the [public-key commitments](../../sidetree.md#public-key-commitment), first, generate two key-pairs:

```[UPDATE_KEY, UPDATE_PRIVATE_KEY]```

```[RECOVERY_KEY, RECOVERY_PRIVATE_KEY]```

2.2 Use the ```UPDATE_KEY``` to generate the update-commitment:

```UPDATE_COMMITMENT``` = [Multihash](../../sidetree.md#hash-protocol).canonicalize[ThenHash](../../sidetree.md#commitment-hash)[ThenEncode](../../sidetree.md#data-encoding-scheme)(```UPDATE_KEY```)

2.2 Use the ```RECOVERY_KEY``` to generate the recovery-commitment:

```RECOVERY_COMMITMENT``` = [Multihash](../../sidetree.md#hash-protocol).canonicalize[ThenHash](../../sidetree.md#commitment-hash)[ThenEncode](../../sidetree.md#data-encoding-scheme)(```RECOVERY_KEY```)

## 3. Service endpoints

Under the property 'service', assign to its value an array of service endpoint objects of type [ServiceEndpointModel](../../implementation/models.md#service-endpoint-model):

```service: ServiceEndpointModel[]```

## 4. Document model

Generate a document of type [DocumentModel](../../implementation/models.md#document-model):

```js
DOCUMENT = {  
    public_keys: publicKeys,  
    service_endpoints: service  
}
```

## 5. DID-State patch

Put the previously generated document inside of a [DID-State patch](../../sidetree.md#did-state-patch). For the DID-Create operation, the patch action is 'Replace':

```js
PATCH = {  
    action: PatchAction.Replace,  
    document: DOCUMENT  
}
```

> ```PATCH``` is of type [PatchModel](../../implementation/models.md#patch-model), with a Replace [PatchAction](../../implementation/models.md#patch-action)

## 6. Create Operation Delta Object

6.1 Using the DID-State patch and the update-commitment, generate an instance of the Create Operation Delta Object as follows:

```js
DELTA = {
    patches: [PATCH],  
    updateCommitment: UPDATE_COMMITMENT  
}
```

> ```DELTA``` is of type [DeltaModel](../../implementation/models.md#delta-model)

Then apply the following operations to the object:

6.2 Stringify it and turn it into a buffer  
6.3 Encode it with the [data encoding scheme](../../sidetree.md#data-encoding-scheme) as ```ENCODED_DELTA```  
6.4 Hash it with the [hash algorithm](../../sidetree.md#hash-algorithm) & [hash protocol](../../sidetree.md#hash-protocol) and then encode it again as ```DELTA_HASH```

## 7. Create Operation Suffix Data Object

7.1 Using the ```DELTA_HASH``` from the previous step, and the recovery-commitment, generate an instance of the Create Operation Suffix Data Object as follows:

```js
SUFFIX_DATA = {  
    delta_hash: DELTA_HASH,  
    recovery_commitment: RECOVERY_COMMITMENT  
}
```

> ```SUFFIX_DATA``` is of type [SuffixDataModel](../../implementation/models.md#suffix-data-model)

Then stringify it and encode it with the [data encoding scheme](../../sidetree.md#data-encoding-scheme) as ```ENCODED_SUFFIX_DATA```.

## 8. Sidetree request

8.1 Generate the following object:

```js
SIDETREE_REQUEST = {  
    suffix_data: ENCODED_SUFFIX_DATA,  
    type: OperationType.Create,  
    delta: ENCODED_DELTA  
}
```

8.2 Stringify it and turn it into a buffer as ```SIDETREE_REQUEST_BUFFER```  
8.3 Process the ```SIDETREE_REQUEST_BUFFER``` with the Sidetree's library CreateOperation, which returns a class with the following properties:

- The original request buffer sent by the requester:

```operationBuffer: Buffer```

- The unique suffix of the DID, globally unique:

```didUniqueSuffix: string```

> The didUniqueSuffix is generated by decoding the `ENCODED_SUFFIX_DATA` as a buffer, then hashing it with the [hash algorithm](../../sidetree.md#hash-algorithm) & [hash protocol](../../sidetree.md#hash-protocol) and then encoding it again with the [data encoding scheme](../../sidetree.md#data-encoding-scheme).

- The type of operation:

```type: OperationType.Create```

- The data used to generate the unique DID-Suffix:

```suffixData: SuffixDataModel```

- The encoded string of the suffix data:

```encodedSuffixData: string```

- The Create Operation Delta Object:

```delta: DeltaModel```

- The encoded string of the delta:

```encodedDelta: string```

## 9. Tyron-Smart-Contract

Every tyronZIL DID MUST deploy a Scilla smart contract called the [Tyron-Smart-Contract(TSM)](https://github.com/julio-cabdu/tyronZIL-js/blob/master/src/lib/blockchain/smart-contracts/tyron0.4.scilla), except when using the DID as an unpropagated [Sidetree Long-Form DID-URI](../../sidetree.md#long-form-did-uri).

The TSM is instantiated from the [TyronInit smart-contract](https://github.com/julio-cabdu/tyronZIL-js/blob/master/src/lib/blockchain/smart-contracts/tyronInit0.1.1.scilla), currently deployed at this Zilliqa address: '0x75d8297b8bd2e35de1c17e19d2c13504de623793'. The client decodes and decompresses the TSM, and then deploys it with the user's Zilliqa address as the 'contract_owner'.

To initialize their TSM, the user MUST call its 'ContractInit' transition and provide the address of the client. This transition sends a message to the 'Initialize' 'transition' of the TyronInit contract that knows how to set the operation cost, client commission and the address of the Pungtas Danish Foundation at the user's TSM-State.

> The Pungtas Danish Foundation will be the socio-economic enterprise developing Tyron

Once the TSM gets initialized, the client MUST submit the DID-Create operation by calling the DidCreate transition, which takes as input the Decentralized Identifier, the encoded DID-Document, the update-commitment and the recovery commitment. The smart-contract then saves these in the TSM-State.

---

The complete submission of a tyronZIL DID-Create operation (incl. the TSM deployment and initialization) consumes approximately 15,000 units of GAS (around 15 ZIL, currently less than 0.3 USD).
