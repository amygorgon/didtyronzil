# tyronZIL DID method specification

A W3C Sidetree-based DID method for the Zilliqa blockchain

Funded by [ZILHive](https://zilhive.org/)

Developed by [Julio Cabrapan Duarte](https://github.com/julio-cabdu)

Conforming to the requirements specified in the:

i. World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) DID specification: [Decentralized
Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/)

ii. Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) [Sidetree protocol specification](https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/)

## Problem summary

Identities on the internet remain centralized, mainly by identity providers such
as Facebook and Google. Thus, when people shop online and login with these
accounts, they don't have enough control nor understanding of how their data
is used and shared with third parties.

Self-sovereign identity (SSI) allows people to prove who they are without a
middleman, by anchoring decentralized identifiers (DIDs) on blockchain
platforms. However, most DLTs still can't provide SSI applications at scale. The
Sidetree protocol aims to solve this issue.
