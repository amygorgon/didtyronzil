The user account on Tyron is its own immutable smart contract code (the SSI.tyron) which deploys diverse and privacy-preserving Decentralized Identifier (DID) dapps. The Tyron DID Method is part of the W3C DID Specification Registries and the first DID Method for the Zilliqa blockchain platform, funded by ZILHive Innovation track. SSI allows people to manage their digital identities, proving who they are without a middleman, by anchoring DIDs on decentralized networks as a shared root of trust. With smart-contract technology, the Tyron SSI Protocol aims to provide decentralized identity at scale and enable user-controlled self-sovereign identities. The meaning of the word 'Tyron' derives from the Greek turannos that means sovereign, and the purpose of this protocol is to give people sovereignty over their data . The Tyron SSI Protocol solves the DID scalability issue by implementing the .tyron smart contracts. The protocol provides the code to instantiate a Self-Sovereign Identity (the SSI.tyron smart contract) which manages upgradable versions of Decentralized Identifier smart contracts. The protocol is non-custodial - the user must show control of their Zilliqa private key for the Self-Sovereign Identity to process their transaction. The user is the owner of the SSI and the SSI the owner of DID dapps. Protocol default parameters Smart-contract implementations: SSI.tyron: Self-Sovereign Identity smart contract (in development) DID.tyron: Decentralized Identifier smart contract INIT.tyron: SSI Initialization & DNS smart contract Smart contracts on Zilliqa get written in Scilla (Smart Contract Intermediate-Level Language) that has a design with a focus on safety, imposing a language structure that makes applications less vulnerable to attacks by eliminating known vulnerabilities directly at the language-level. Scilla provides formal verification with embedding into the Coq proof assistant . The Tyron Decentralized Identifier Method v2.0.0 Identities on the internet remain centralized, mainly by identity providers such as Facebook, Google and PayPal. Thus, when people shop online and login with these accounts, they don't have enough control nor understanding of how their data is used and shared with third parties. Furthermore, decentralized applications are still difficult to grasp for most regular users, and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) can make the user experience much better while increasing privacy and security. This DID Method is part of the open-source Tyron SSI Protocol that defines its: Scheme: DID Scheme DID-URL syntax DID Document DID CRUD operations: Create Resolve Recover Update Deactivate Security & privacy considerations Conformance This DID Method specification is conformant with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0 specification.

Decentralized Identifier (DID) A DID is a globally unique Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that associates a DID Subject with a DID Document. Given the decentralized nature of Zilliqa, a Tyron DID has its existence guaranteed without depending on a central authority. A DID consists of three parts: The scheme identifier: \"did\" The DID Method identifier The DID Method-specific identifier, which must be unique The Tyron DID Scheme . DID URL A DID URL identifies a particular resource to be located, e.g. a specific part of the DID Document. It extends the syntax of a basic DID to incorporate other standard URI components: Path: The portion of a DID URL that begins with and includes the first forward slash character, \"/\" Query: The portion of a DID URL that follows the first question mark character, \"?\" Fragment: The portion of a DID URL that follows the first hash sign character \"#\" DID Subject The DID Subject is the entity identified by the DID and described by the DID Document - the user of the Decentralized Identifier. DID Controller The DID Controller is the entity that has the capability - as defined by the DID Method - to make changes to a DID Document. DID Document A DID is resolvable to a DID Document, which contains data associated with the DID, such as cryptographic material, verification methods and service endpoints relevant to interactions with the DID Subject. The DID itself is the value of the id property. Read the Tyron DID Document specification here . Verification method A verification method is a set of parameters used to independently verify a proof according to the particular DID Method, e.g. a public key. Verification relationship It expresses the relationship between the DID Subject and a verification method, e.g. authentication. All verification methods must be associated with a particular verification relationship. Producer A producer is any algorithm realized as software/hardware that conforms to the W3C DIDs specification by generating conforming DIDs or conforming DID documents. A producer that is conformant with the specification MUST NOT produce non-conforming DIDs or DID documents. Producers MUST indicate which representation of a document corresponds via a 'contentType' in the document's resolution-metadata. Consumer A consumer is any algorithm realized as software/hardware that conforms to the W3C DIDs specification by consuming conforming DIDs or conforming DID documents.

Given the 'public' nature of the network, Tyron anticipates that messages could be read, or corrupted in case of chain-reorganization. However, as long as there is no 51% attack the ledger's immutability, on which DIDs rely on, remains uncompromised. The tyronzil SSI client currently interacts with Zilliqa nodes hosted by Zilliqa Research Pte. Ltd. as can be seen in the open-source code . It is also possible to submit transactions to any other node. To interact with the user's DID smart contract , the client MUST submit a blockchain transaction. All Zilliqa transactions require an increasing nonce, mitigating this way replay attacks. The user can check their DID smart contract on, e.g. Devex to confirm that their operation did not get delayed. Furthermore, timestamps are supported and coded into the DID contract. Smart contract security Scilla implements smart contract safety at the language level with formal verification. It utilizes the Coq Proof Assistant for mechanized proofs about programs' properties. Key revocation, DID recovery & deactivation If a key is compromised, it is possible to remove it through a DID Update operation with a 'RemoveKeys' patch-action. To perform a DID operation, the user MUST posess the private did_update_key that corresponds to the public did_update_key stored in the DID smart contract, ensuring that any insertion, deletion or modification happens under stipulated terms. If the private did_update_key is compromised, the user can request a DID Recover operation to replace their DID State, completely. The DID Deactivate operation is also supported as long as the private did_recovery_key is not compromised. Privacy Considerations This DID Method focuses on principle #7 of Privacy by Design: \"Respect for user privacy \u2014 keep it user-centric\". As a consequence, the user as the DID Subject is the sole DID Controller of their Decentralized Identifier. Keep Personally-Identifiable Information (PII) private Given that Zilliqa is a public & decentralized network, personal data MUST NOT get included in the DID Document , ensuring the user's right to be forgotten All personal information MUST exist behind service endpoints, under the user's control. The exchange of personal data MUST occur on private, peer-to-peer communication channels. Correlation risk The user MUST be aware that if using their Tyron DID with more than one party, then they are implicitly authorizing correlation between those parties. To mitigate this, a user can have as many Decentralized Identifiers as needed to engage in pairwise interactions. Either way, correlation can still occur if the same keys or personal service endpoints get used in different DID documents. Unique endpoints allow traffic to be easily correlated, so a better strategy is to share an endpoint among many DIDs.

In that spirit, the user is the owner of their DID smart contract and MUST be the caller to every transition that affects the DID State. On the other hand, the user relies on servers and cloud infrastructure that is provided by the SSI agents (e.g., pungtas.agent). Tyron Pungtas is the open organization developing tyron as a foundation. Decentralization and tertiarization of services aim at being integrated by regionally diverse SSI agents. In future tyron improvement proposals, there will be an agent.tyron smart contract developed. The release of the SSI client tyronzil v2.0 introduces the concept of the SSI Trinity integrated by the domain name systems user.did , avatar.agent and contract.tyron - it gets defined by the DID smart contract as follows: (* The SSI Trinity ADT *) (*---------------------*) type SsiTrinity = | User (* the contract owner *) | Agent of String (* the agent is the entity running the SSI client) | Tyron (* the .tyron contracts *) Find the INIT.tyron's code on GitHub.","title":"INIT.tyron: The SSI Initialization &amp; Domain Name System Smart Contract"},{"location":"smart-contracts/INIT.tyron/#immutable-fields","text":"Immutable fields are set at deployment and can not get modified.
