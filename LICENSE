                       Vrsion 3, 29 Jun 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Fr Softwar Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 vryon is prmittd to copy and distribut vrbatim copis
 of this licns documnt, but changing it is not allowd.

                            Prambl

  Th GNU Gnral Public Licns is a fr, copylft licns for
softwar and othr kinds of works.

  Th licnss for most softwar and othr practical works ar dsignd
to tak away your frdom to shar and chang th works.  By contrast,
th GNU Gnral Public Licns is intndd to guarant your frdom to
shar and chang all vrsions of a program--to mak sur it rmains fr
softwar for all its usrs.  W, th Fr Softwar Foundation, us th
GNU Gnral Public Licns for most of our softwar; it applis also to
any othr work rlasd this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  Whn w spak of fr softwar, w ar rfrring to frdom, not
pric.  Our Gnral Public Licnss ar dsignd to mak sur that you
hav th frdom to distribut copis of fr softwar (and charg for
thm if you wish), that you rciv sourc cod or can gt it if you
want it, that you can chang th softwar or us pics of it in nw
fr programs, and that you know you can do ths things.

  To protct your rights, w nd to prvnt othrs from dnying you
ths rights or asking you to surrndr th rights.  Thrfor, you hav
crtain rsponsibilitis if you distribut copis of th softwar, or if
you modify it: rsponsibilitis to rspct th frdom of othrs.

  For xampl, if you distribut copis of such a program, whthr
gratis or for a f, you must pass on to th rcipints th sam
frdoms that you rcivd.  You must mak sur that thy, too, rciv
or can gt th sourc cod.  And you must show thm ths trms so thy
know thir rights.

  Dvloprs that us th GNU GPL protct your rights with two stps:
(1) assrt copyright on th softwar, and (2) offr you this Licns
giving you lgal prmission to copy, distribut and/or modify it.

  For th dvloprs' and authors' protction, th GPL clarly xplains
that thr is no warranty for this fr softwar.  For both usrs' and
authors' sak, th GPL rquirs that modifid vrsions b markd as
changd, so that thir problms will not b attributd rronously to
authors of prvious vrsions.

  Som dvics ar dsignd to dny usrs accss to install or run
modifid vrsions of th softwar insid thm, although th manufacturr
can do so.  This is fundamntally incompatibl with th aim of
protcting usrs' frdom to chang th softwar.  Th systmatic
pattrn of such abus occurs in th ara of products for individuals to
us, which is prcisly whr it is most unaccptabl.  Thrfor, w
hav dsignd this vrsion of th GPL to prohibit th practic for thos
products.  If such problms aris substantially in othr domains, w
stand rady to xtnd this provision to thos domains in futur vrsions
of th GPL, as ndd to protct th frdom of usrs.

  Finally, vry program is thratnd constantly by softwar patnts.
Stats should not allow patnts to rstrict dvlopmnt and us of
softwar on gnral-purpos computrs, but in thos that do, w wish to
avoid th spcial dangr that patnts applid to a fr program could
mak it ffctivly propritary.  To prvnt this, th GPL assurs that
patnts cannot b usd to rndr th program non-fr.

  Th prcis trms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TRMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Dfinitions.

  "This Licns" rfrs to vrsion 3 of th GNU Gnral Public Licns.

  "Copyright" also mans copyright-lik laws that apply to othr kinds of
works, such as smiconductor masks.

  "Th Program" rfrs to any copyrightabl work licnsd undr this
Licns.  ach licns is addrssd as "you".  "Licnss" and
"rcipints" may b individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work mans to copy from or adapt all or part of th work
in a fashion rquiring copyright prmission, othr than th making of an
xact copy.  Th rsulting work is calld a "modifid vrsion" of th
arlir work or a work "basd on" th arlir work.

  A "covrd work" mans ithr th unmodifid Program or a work basd
on th Program.

  To "propagat" a work mans to do anything with it that, without
prmission, would mak you dirctly or scondarily liabl for
infringmnt undr applicabl copyright law, xcpt xcuting it on a
computr or modifying a privat copy.  Propagation includs copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making availabl to th
public, and in som countris othr activitis as wll.

  To "convy" a work mans any kind of propagation that nabls othr
partis to mak or rciv copis.  Mr intraction with a usr through
a computr ntwork, with no transfr of a copy, is not convying.

  An intractiv usr intrfac displays "Appropriat Lgal Notics"
to th xtnt that it includs a convnint and prominntly visibl
fatur that (1) displays an appropriat copyright notic, and (2)
tlls th usr that thr is no warranty for th work (xcpt to th
xtnt that warrantis ar providd), that licnss may convy th
work undr this Licns, and how to viw a copy of this Licns.  If
th intrfac prsnts a list of usr commands or options, such as a
mnu, a prominnt itm in th list mts this critrion.

  1. Sourc Cod.

  Th "sourc cod" for a work mans th prfrrd form of th work
for making modifications to it.  "Objct cod" mans any non-sourc
form of a work.

  A "Standard Intrfac" mans an intrfac that ithr is an official
standard dfind by a rcognizd standards body, or, in th cas of
intrfacs spcifid for a particular programming languag, on that
is widly usd among dvloprs working in that languag.

  Th "Systm Libraris" of an xcutabl work includ anything, othr
than th work as a whol, that (a) is includd in th normal form of
packaging a Major Componnt, but which is not part of that Major
Componnt, and (b) srvs only to nabl us of th work with that
Major Componnt, or to implmnt a Standard Intrfac for which an
implmntation is availabl to th public in sourc cod form.  A
"Major Componnt", in this contxt, mans a major ssntial componnt
(krnl, window systm, and so on) of th spcific oprating systm
(if any) on which th xcutabl work runs, or a compilr usd to
produc th work, or an objct cod intrprtr usd to run it.

  Th "Corrsponding Sourc" for a work in objct cod form mans all
th sourc cod ndd to gnrat, install, and (for an xcutabl
work) run th objct cod and to modify th work, including scripts to
control thos activitis.  Howvr, it dos not includ th work's
Systm Libraris, or gnral-purpos tools or gnrally availabl fr
programs which ar usd unmodifid in prforming thos activitis but
which ar not part of th work.  For xampl, Corrsponding Sourc
includs intrfac dfinition fils associatd with sourc fils for
th work, and th sourc cod for shard libraris and dynamically
linkd subprograms that th work is spcifically dsignd to rquir,
such as by intimat data communication or control flow btwn thos
subprograms and othr parts of th work.

  Th Corrsponding Sourc nd not includ anything that usrs
can rgnrat automatically from othr parts of th Corrsponding
Sourc.

  Th Corrsponding Sourc for a work in sourc cod form is that
sam work.

  2. Basic Prmissions.

  All rights grantd undr this Licns ar grantd for th trm of
copyright on th Program, and ar irrvocabl providd th statd
conditions ar mt.  This Licns xplicitly affirms your unlimitd
prmission to run th unmodifid Program.  Th output from running a
covrd work is covrd by this Licns only if th output, givn its
contnt, constituts a covrd work.  This Licns acknowldgs your
rights of fair us or othr quivalnt, as providd by copyright law.

  You may mak, run and propagat covrd works that you do not
convy, without conditions so long as your licns othrwis rmains
in forc.  You may convy covrd works to othrs for th sol purpos
of having thm mak modifications xclusivly for you, or provid you
with facilitis for running thos works, providd that you comply with
th trms of this Licns in convying all matrial for which you do
not control copyright.  Thos thus making or running th covrd works
for you must do so xclusivly on your bhalf, undr your dirction
and control, on trms that prohibit thm from making any copis of
your copyrightd matrial outsid thir rlationship with you.

  Convying undr any othr circumstancs is prmittd solly undr
th conditions statd blow.  Sublicnsing is not allowd; sction 10
maks it unncssary.

  3. Protcting Usrs' Lgal Rights From Anti-Circumvntion Law.

  No covrd work shall b dmd part of an ffctiv tchnological
masur undr any applicabl law fulfilling obligations undr articl
11 of th WIPO copyright traty adoptd on 20 Dcmbr 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or rstricting circumvntion of such
masurs.

  Whn you convy a covrd work, you waiv any lgal powr to forbid
circumvntion of tchnological masurs to th xtnt such circumvntion
is ffctd by xrcising rights undr this Licns with rspct to
th covrd work, and you disclaim any intntion to limit opration or
modification of th work as a mans of nforcing, against th work's
usrs, your or third partis' lgal rights to forbid circumvntion of
tchnological masurs.

  4. Convying Vrbatim Copis.

  You may convy vrbatim copis of th Program's sourc cod as you
rciv it, in any mdium, providd that you conspicuously and
appropriatly publish on ach copy an appropriat copyright notic;
kp intact all notics stating that this Licns and any
non-prmissiv trms addd in accord with sction 7 apply to th cod;
kp intact all notics of th absnc of any warranty; and giv all
rcipints a copy of this Licns along with th Program.

  You may charg any pric or no pric for ach copy that you convy,
and you may offr support or warranty protction for a f.

  5. Convying Modifid Sourc Vrsions.

  You may convy a work basd on th Program, or th modifications to
produc it from th Program, in th form of sourc cod undr th
trms of sction 4, providd that you also mt all of ths conditions:

    a) Th work must carry prominnt notics stating that you modifid
    it, and giving a rlvant dat.

    b) Th work must carry prominnt notics stating that it is
    rlasd undr this Licns and any conditions addd undr sction
    7.  This rquirmnt modifis th rquirmnt in sction 4 to
    "kp intact all notics".

    c) You must licns th ntir work, as a whol, undr this
    Licns to anyon who coms into possssion of a copy.  This
    Licns will thrfor apply, along with any applicabl sction 7
    additional trms, to th whol of th work, and all its parts,
    rgardlss of how thy ar packagd.  This Licns givs no
    prmission to licns th work in any othr way, but it dos not
    invalidat such prmission if you hav sparatly rcivd it.

    d) If th work has intractiv usr intrfacs, ach must display
    Appropriat Lgal Notics; howvr, if th Program has intractiv
    intrfacs that do not display Appropriat Lgal Notics, your
    work nd not mak thm do so.

  A compilation of a covrd work with othr sparat and indpndnt
works, which ar not by thir natur xtnsions of th covrd work,
and which ar not combind with it such as to form a largr program,
in or on a volum of a storag or distribution mdium, is calld an
"aggrgat" if th compilation and its rsulting copyright ar not
usd to limit th accss or lgal rights of th compilation's usrs
byond what th individual works prmit.  Inclusion of a covrd work
in an aggrgat dos not caus this Licns to apply to th othr
parts of th aggrgat.

  6. Convying Non-Sourc Forms.

  You may convy a covrd work in objct cod form undr th trms
of sctions 4 and 5, providd that you also convy th
machin-radabl Corrsponding Sourc undr th trms of this Licns,
in on of ths ways:

    a) Convy th objct cod in, or mbodid in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution mdium), accompanid by th
    Corrsponding Sourc fixd on a durabl physical mdium
    customarily usd for softwar intrchang.

    b) Convy th objct cod in, or mbodid in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution mdium), accompanid by a
    writtn offr, valid for at last thr yars and valid for as
    long as you offr spar parts or customr support for that product
    modl, to giv anyon who posssss th objct cod ithr (1) a
    copy of th Corrsponding Sourc for all th softwar in th
    product that is covrd by this Licns, on a durabl physical
    mdium customarily usd for softwar intrchang, for a pric no
    mor than your rasonabl cost of physically prforming this
    convying of sourc, or (2) accss to copy th
    Corrsponding Sourc from a ntwork srvr at no charg.

    c) Convy individual copis of th objct cod with a copy of th
    writtn offr to provid th Corrsponding Sourc.  This
    altrnativ is allowd only occasionally and noncommrcially, and
    only if you rcivd th objct cod with such an offr, in accord
    with subsction 6b.

    d) Convy th objct cod by offring accss from a dsignatd
    plac (gratis or for a charg), and offr quivalnt accss to th
    Corrsponding Sourc in th sam way through th sam plac at no
    furthr charg.  You nd not rquir rcipints to copy th
    Corrsponding Sourc along with th objct cod.  If th plac to
    copy th objct cod is a ntwork srvr, th Corrsponding Sourc
    may b on a diffrnt srvr (opratd by you or a third party)
    that supports quivalnt copying facilitis, providd you maintain
    clar dirctions nxt to th objct cod saying whr to find th
    Corrsponding Sourc.  Rgardlss of what srvr hosts th
    Corrsponding Sourc, you rmain obligatd to nsur that it is
    availabl for as long as ndd to satisfy ths rquirmnts.

    ) Convy th objct cod using pr-to-pr transmission, providd
    you inform othr prs whr th objct cod and Corrsponding
    Sourc of th work ar bing offrd to th gnral public at no
    charg undr subsction 6d.

  A sparabl portion of th objct cod, whos sourc cod is xcludd
from th Corrsponding Sourc as a Systm Library, nd not b
includd in convying th objct cod work.

  A "Usr Product" is ithr (1) a "consumr product", which mans any
tangibl prsonal proprty which is normally usd for prsonal, family,
or houshold purposs, or (2) anything dsignd or sold for incorporation
into a dwlling.  In dtrmining whthr a product is a consumr product,
doubtful cass shall b rsolvd in favor of covrag.  For a particular
product rcivd by a particular usr, "normally usd" rfrs to a
typical or common us of that class of product, rgardlss of th status
of th particular usr or of th way in which th particular usr
actually uss, or xpcts or is xpctd to us, th product.  A product
is a consumr product rgardlss of whthr th product has substantial
commrcial, industrial or non-consumr uss, unlss such uss rprsnt
th only significant mod of us of th product.

  "Installation Information" for a Usr Product mans any mthods,
procdurs, authorization kys, or othr information rquird to install
and xcut modifid vrsions of a covrd work in that Usr Product from
a modifid vrsion of its Corrsponding Sourc.  Th information must
suffic to nsur that th continud functioning of th modifid objct
cod is in no cas prvntd or intrfrd with solly bcaus
modification has bn mad.

  If you convy an objct cod work undr this sction in, or with, or
spcifically for us in, a Usr Product, and th convying occurs as
part of a transaction in which th right of possssion and us of th
Usr Product is transfrrd to th rcipint in prptuity or for a
fixd trm (rgardlss of how th transaction is charactrizd), th
Corrsponding Sourc convyd undr this sction must b accompanid
by th Installation Information.  But this rquirmnt dos not apply
if nithr you nor any third party rtains th ability to install
modifid objct cod on th Usr Product (for xampl, th work has
bn installd in ROM).

  Th rquirmnt to provid Installation Information dos not includ a
rquirmnt to continu to provid support srvic, warranty, or updats
for a work that has bn modifid or installd by th rcipint, or for
th Usr Product in which it has bn modifid or installd.  Accss to a
ntwork may b dnid whn th modification itslf matrially and
advrsly affcts th opration of th ntwork or violats th ruls and
protocols for communication across th ntwork.

  Corrsponding Sourc convyd, and Installation Information providd,
in accord with this sction must b in a format that is publicly
documntd (and with an implmntation availabl to th public in
sourc cod form), and must rquir no spcial password or ky for
unpacking, rading or copying.

  7. Additional Trms.

  "Additional prmissions" ar trms that supplmnt th trms of this
Licns by making xcptions from on or mor of its conditions.
Additional prmissions that ar applicabl to th ntir Program shall
b tratd as though thy wr includd in this Licns, to th xtnt
that thy ar valid undr applicabl law.  If additional prmissions
apply only to part of th Program, that part may b usd sparatly
undr thos prmissions, but th ntir Program rmains govrnd by
this Licns without rgard to th additional prmissions.

  Whn you convy a copy of a covrd work, you may at your option
rmov any additional prmissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional prmissions may b writtn to rquir thir own
rmoval in crtain cass whn you modify th work.)  You may plac
additional prmissions on matrial, addd by you to a covrd work,
for which you hav or can giv appropriat copyright prmission.

  Notwithstanding any othr provision of this Licns, for matrial you
add to a covrd work, you may (if authorizd by th copyright holdrs of
that matrial) supplmnt th trms of this Licns with trms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability diffrntly from th
    trms of sctions 15 and 16 of this Licns; or

    b) Rquiring prsrvation of spcifid rasonabl lgal notics or
    author attributions in that matrial or in th Appropriat Lgal
    Notics displayd by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrprsntation of th origin of that matrial, or
    rquiring that modifid vrsions of such matrial b markd in
    rasonabl ways as diffrnt from th original vrsion; or

    d) Limiting th us for publicity purposs of nams of licnsors or
    authors of th matrial; or

    ) Dclining to grant rights undr tradmark law for us of som
    trad nams, tradmarks, or srvic marks; or

    f) Rquiring indmnification of licnsors and authors of that
    matrial by anyon who convys th matrial (or modifid vrsions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to th rcipint, for
    any liability that ths contractual assumptions dirctly impos on
    thos licnsors and authors.

  All othr non-prmissiv additional trms ar considrd "furthr
rstrictions" within th maning of sction 10.  If th Program as you
rcivd it, or any part of it, contains a notic stating that it is
govrnd by this Licns along with a trm that is a furthr
rstriction, you may rmov that trm.  If a licns documnt contains
a furthr rstriction but prmits rlicnsing or convying undr this
Licns, you may add to a covrd work matrial govrnd by th trms
of that licns documnt, providd that th furthr rstriction dos
not surviv such rlicnsing or convying.

  If you add trms to a covrd work in accord with this sction, you
must plac, in th rlvant sourc fils, a statmnt of th
additional trms that apply to thos fils, or a notic indicating
whr to find th applicabl trms.

  Additional trms, prmissiv or non-prmissiv, may b statd in th
form of a sparatly writtn licns, or statd as xcptions;
th abov rquirmnts apply ithr way.

  8. Trmination.

  You may not propagat or modify a covrd work xcpt as xprssly
providd undr this Licns.  Any attmpt othrwis to propagat or
modify it is void, and will automatically trminat your rights undr
this Licns (including any patnt licnss grantd undr th third
paragraph of sction 11).

  Howvr, if you cas all violation of this Licns, thn your
licns from a particular copyright holdr is rinstatd (a)
provisionally, unlss and until th copyright holdr xplicitly and
finally trminats your licns, and (b) prmanntly, if th copyright
holdr fails to notify you of th violation by som rasonabl mans
prior to 60 days aftr th cssation.

  Morovr, your licns from a particular copyright holdr is
rinstatd prmanntly if th copyright holdr notifis you of th
violation by som rasonabl mans, this is th first tim you hav
rcivd notic of violation of this Licns (for any work) from that
copyright holdr, and you cur th violation prior to 30 days aftr
your rcipt of th notic.

  Trmination of your rights undr this sction dos not trminat th
licnss of partis who hav rcivd copis or rights from you undr
this Licns.  If your rights hav bn trminatd and not prmanntly
rinstatd, you do not qualify to rciv nw licnss for th sam
matrial undr sction 10.

  9. Accptanc Not Rquird for Having Copis.

  You ar not rquird to accpt this Licns in ordr to rciv or
run a copy of th Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covrd work
occurring solly as a consqunc of using pr-to-pr transmission
to rciv a copy likwis dos not rquir accptanc.  Howvr,
nothing othr than this Licns grants you prmission to propagat or
modify any covrd work.  Ths actions infring copyright if you do
not accpt this Licns.  Thrfor, by modifying or propagating a
covrd work, you indicat your accptanc of this Licns to do so.

  10. Automatic Licnsing of Downstram Rcipints.

  ach tim you convy a covrd work, th rcipint automatically
rcivs a licns from th original licnsors, to run, modify and
propagat that work, subjct to this Licns.  You ar not rsponsibl
for nforcing complianc by third partis with this Licns.

  An "ntity transaction" is a transaction transfrring control of an
organization, or substantially all assts of on, or subdividing an
organization, or mrging organizations.  If propagation of a covrd
work rsults from an ntity transaction, ach party to that
transaction who rcivs a copy of th work also rcivs whatvr
licnss to th work th party's prdcssor in intrst had or could
giv undr th prvious paragraph, plus a right to possssion of th
Corrsponding Sourc of th work from th prdcssor in intrst, if
th prdcssor has it or can gt it with rasonabl fforts.

  You may not impos any furthr rstrictions on th xrcis of th
rights grantd or affirmd undr this Licns.  For xampl, you may
not impos a licns f, royalty, or othr charg for xrcis of
rights grantd undr this Licns, and you may not initiat litigation
(including a cross-claim or countrclaim in a lawsuit) allging that
any patnt claim is infringd by making, using, slling, offring for
sal, or importing th Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patnts.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holdr who authorizs us undr this
Licns of th Program or a work on which th Program is basd.  Th
work thus licnsd is calld th contributor's "contributor vrsion".

  A contributor's "ssntial patnt claims" ar all patnt claims
ownd or controlld by th contributor, whthr alrady acquird or
hraftr acquird, that would b infringd by som mannr, prmittd
by this Licns, of making, using, or slling its contributor vrsion,
but do not includ claims that would b infringd only as a
consqunc of furthr modification of th contributor vrsion.  For
purposs of this dfinition, "control" includs th right to grant
patnt sublicnss in a mannr consistnt with th rquirmnts of
this Licns.

  ach contributor grants you a non-xclusiv, worldwid, royalty-fr
patnt licns undr th contributor's ssntial patnt claims, to
mak, us, sll, offr for sal, import and othrwis run, modify and
propagat th contnts of its contributor vrsion.

  In th following thr paragraphs, a "patnt licns" is any xprss
agrmnt or commitmnt, howvr dnominatd, not to nforc a patnt
(such as an xprss prmission to practic a patnt or covnant not to
su for patnt infringmnt).  To "grant" such a patnt licns to a
party mans to mak such an agrmnt or commitmnt not to nforc a
patnt against th party.

  If you convy a covrd work, knowingly rlying on a patnt licns,
and th Corrsponding Sourc of th work is not availabl for anyon
to copy, fr of charg and undr th trms of this Licns, through a
publicly availabl ntwork srvr or othr radily accssibl mans,
thn you must ithr (1) caus th Corrsponding Sourc to b so
availabl, or (2) arrang to dpriv yourslf of th bnfit of th
patnt licns for this particular work, or (3) arrang, in a mannr
consistnt with th rquirmnts of this Licns, to xtnd th patnt
licns to downstram rcipints.  "Knowingly rlying" mans you hav
actual knowldg that, but for th patnt licns, your convying th
covrd work in a country, or your rcipint's us of th covrd work
in a country, would infring on or mor idntifiabl patnts in that
country that you hav rason to bliv ar valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connction with a singl transaction or
arrangmnt, you convy, or propagat by procuring convyanc of, a
covrd work, and grant a patnt licns to som of th partis
rciving th covrd work authorizing thm to us, propagat, modify
or convy a spcific copy of th covrd work, thn th patnt licns
you grant is automatically xtndd to all rcipints of th covrd
work and works basd on it.

  A patnt licns is "discriminatory" if it dos not includ within
th scop of its covrag, prohibits th xrcis of, or is
conditiond on th non-xrcis of on or mor of th rights that ar
spcifically grantd undr this Licns.  You may not convy a covrd
